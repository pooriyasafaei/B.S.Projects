<h2>Flight Service Backends</h2>
<p>A flight reservation back-end service implemented with nodejs.</p>

<h2>SAW</h2>
<p>When studying self-avoiding walks of length n, we encounter challenges due to the growing state space, especially for large n, and even random
sampling from it can be quite difficult. The aim is to statistically investigate various properties of self-avoiding walks by implementing an MCMC
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithm.</p>

<h5>Note: Other bachelor projects will be added to this repository. Some of my projects are private and cannot be publicly shared at this time</h5>
