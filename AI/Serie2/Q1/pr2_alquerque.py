In this problem you must implement a minimax agent to play a game known as Alquerque.

The game has already been implemented for you. You should implement these things:  
Complete the three minimax players (minmax, alpha-beta pruning) and random player classes. For the first minmax player you must create the minimax tree until you reach a desired depth or a cutoff state. Then you must use an evaluation function in `Game` class to score the nodes and find the best next move. For the second one, you must do all the above but using alpha beta pruning algorithm.

*** Note that, the result from the game is a part of your score and a small portion of your score is evaluated based on the quality of your code.

# Game rules:
You can play Alquerque <a href="https://omerkel.github.io/Alquerque/html5/src/">here</a>.
Before starting, each player places their twelve pieces in the two rows closest to them and in the two rightmost spaces in the center row. The game is played in turns, with one player taking red and the other blue.
<ul>
<li> A piece can move from its point to any empty adjacent point that is <b>  connected by a line. </b> </li>
<li> A piece can jump over an opposing piece and remove it from the game, if that opposing piece is adjacent and the point beyond it is empty.</li>
</ul>

</br>

*** The goal of the game is to get more score. Players play for 100 round, Finally each player score come from below equation:


$$\displaystyle score=(remain \; pieces)+5Ã—(pieces \; taken \; from \; opponent)$$


The player with higher score win the game.
